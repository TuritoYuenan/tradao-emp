## Project Idea

I create a platform to manage community events organised by [ITea Lab](https://github.com/itea-lab). In this platform, lab members can create and organise events, that can be registered by everyone looking to participate. Participants will enter their information to register and receive a button to add a digital ticket to their Google Wallet.
